    <p>Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or neighborhood goes ages without being resolved?<br></br> You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas), overgrown plants, or anything else that makes living where you live a little less pleasant.<br></br> With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues you would like to see resolved in your community.</p> 
<p>Three simple steps: <br></br>
1. Describe the problem. <br></br>
2. Other locals upvote the problem. <br></br>
3. Problems with the most upvotes get prioritized by local government or HOAâ€™s to be resolved first.</p>

<p>As well as seeing real change in your community, you get rewards for being a positive community member in the form of points, freebies and local recognition.<br></br> 

The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the relationship between local government and the people they represent. </p>
